# All there is to know about `ffmpeg`

## 1: Basics

### 1.1: Formats

All formats that work with ffmpeg are the following: too many, even audio and images alone. 

Through trial and error, I even found out that RoQ format (video format used in idtech3 games eg. Quake 3 Arena) is supported.

I didn't bother trying with *mov*s and *gifv* files.
I never tried with *mid* and *mod* files.






* Coming soon!
